# HUPLACLIP - A statistical-to-computational gap for intuitive human inference 

The project consists in an implementation of the planted clique problem using the JSPsych library.
The primary aim is to characterize under which conditions humans typically succeed or fail at the task, and to compare that with the predictions of the theory where the problem originated and was studied.
This project involves both SISSA and ICTP.
